# JHS Morning Glory Copycat Pedal

## About

This project is a work in progress, but my goal is to make an overdrive pedal for my guitar that emulates the JHS Morning Glory. The Morning Glory is an extremely popular overdrive pedal that happened to have a circuit schematic available online for free. I am in the process of turning that schematic into a PCB using KiCAD and JLC PCB.

My plan:

1. Design the schematic
2. Design the layout
3. Fabricate the PCB
4. Solder all the components
5. Design and 3D print a housing for the PCB using Autodesk Fusion

Stay posted for results!
