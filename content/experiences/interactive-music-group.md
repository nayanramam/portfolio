# Project Manager | Interactive Music Group

## The Team
The Interactive Music Group is a research team within Georgia Tech's Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) undergraduate research program. We are a team of 6 working under the guidance of Prof. Alexandria Smith. I joined the team in August, at the start of the Fall semester.

## The Project
Prior to my joining, the team was developing a rhythm box with biological sensors (e.g. heart rate, galvanic skin response) as the inputs, but we soon decided to pivot to an idea of mine heavily inspired by my [AI Synth project](../projects/ai-synth.html). My project used an LLM to generate presets for a synthesizer, but I wanted to unlock another level of flexibility. Instead of generating presets, we are generating the synth. The premise is to use AI to be able to rapidly create instruments with highly specific functionality. What gives this such utility is that we are closely embedding this software with a physical device. Leveraging the high computational capabilities of the Daisy Seed, we are able to run complex patches and control them using an assortment of sensors (potentiometers, pads, etc.) with minimal latency. By intertwining the hardware and software, the effectiveness of each aspect is amplified. The flexibility of the software enables users to utilize the sensors in any way they desire, so a single potentiometer could control LFO, a lowpass filter, or volume, while a ribbon sensor could be a pitch bend or trigger an instrument.

## My Role
I am the project manager, so much of the task assignment and roadmapping is a collaborative effort between Prof. Smith and I. As the team's electrical engineering major, I also handle the PCB design, work with the Daisy Seed microcontroller, and I am designing a force sensitive drum pad using hall effect ICs. I am heavily involved in the software development as well.
